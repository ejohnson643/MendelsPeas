# MendelsPeas
A live coding exercise using data from Gregor Mendel himself!

In this brief demonstration, we will practice the skills involved in performing an empirical hypothesis test:
- Identifying a quantitative feature
- Formulating a hypothesis (about this feature)
- Simulating this hypothesis
- Comparing our data to the hypothesis
